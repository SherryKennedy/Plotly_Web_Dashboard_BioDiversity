Built an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Setup
Used the following ***directory***  and  file setup:

-***root*** directory
- files in root directory:
- index.html
- README.md

-***static***  (under the root directory)
- folders in static directory:
- ***css***   - files in css directory: main.css
- ***js***    - files in js directory: app.js , gauge.js
- ***images***  - files in images directory: bactieria.jpg , hw02.png

-***data***  (under the root directory)
- files in data directory:
- samples.json

## NOTE:
* When running locally on your computer, d3 needs a local server
[Local Server Setup](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server )


## Step 1: Plotly
1. Used the D3 library to read in `samples.json`.

2. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

* Used `sample_values` as the values for the bar chart.

* Used `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.

* Used `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.


3. Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.

* Used `otu_ids` for the x values.

* Used `sample_values` for the y values.

* Used `sample_values` for the marker size.

* Used `otu_ids` for the marker colors.

* Used `otu_labels` for the text values.


4. Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

5. Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.


6. Updated all of the plots any time a new sample is selected.

7. Created a Gauge Chart.

* Adapted the Gauge Chart from <https://plot.ly/javascript/gauge-charts/> to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

* Modified the example gauge code to account for values ranging from 0 through 9.

* Updated the chart whenever a new sample is selected.

## Additional
* Used `console.log` inside of the JavaScript code to see what the data looks like at each step.

* Referred to the [Plotly.js documentation](https://plot.ly/javascript/) when building the plots.



## Deployment

* Deployed the app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages.

* Ensured the repository has a README.md file
